# Unity_Course_Academic

This repository contains a collection of Unity projects developed for academic purposes, including practical exercises and demonstrations in Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Avatar Systems. These materials are designed to support lectures and workshops on immersive technologies using Unity.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### `AR_demo_android`
An Augmented Reality demo project built for Android devices. This example shows how to integrate AR functionalities using Unity, such as surface detection and virtual object placement.

### `AVATAR_SDK_TEST`
A prototype for testing avatar integration within Unity. It may involve the use of external SDKs to support avatar customization, tracking, and animation.

### `Unity_basics`
Introductory Unity projects aimed at students with no prior experience. These cover fundamental concepts such as scene management, object interaction, UI, and simple scripting.

### `google_cardboard_sdk`
A project using Google's Cardboard SDK to create VR experiences compatible with Google Cardboard headsets. Includes stereo rendering, head tracking, and basic interaction features.

### `class_vr`
Projects created to explore Virtual Reality development using the **Meta XR SDK**. These demos showcase interactive VR scenarios using Meta Quest-compatible features such as hand tracking, teleportation, object grabbing, and UI interaction.

> Note: To run the `class_vr` projects, please make sure you have the **Meta XR SDK** installed and properly configured within your Unity environment.
